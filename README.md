# Simple MultiThreading With Delay in C++

* Headers Used =>

* iostream   =   input / output Stream
* conio.h    =   To get input while runtime 
* cstdlib    =   To Use System Commands like = system("CLS")
* string     =   String Support (Array of char)
* thread     =   MultiThreading
* vector     =   Dynamic Fast Access Array
* chrono     =   Time Management Header
* mutex      =   Stoping Data Access for a shared data between threads
* map        =   Arrays with key possiblity to access the elements 



## Build & Run

* I have used VisualStudio 2022 to build and compile it both in Release and Debug for x64 bit .



## Usage

* At first it was my playground to learn MultiThreading for TCP/IP and DX12 while i am a Graphics Programmer With DirectX12 ,
 then i thought it can be perfect for someone like me who wants to learn MultiThreading and other headers that i included
 so i made a straight forward explanation with Comments for others who wants learn .

* hope it helps your learning Process and have fun using ( S , Esc ) Keys on Keyboard .
